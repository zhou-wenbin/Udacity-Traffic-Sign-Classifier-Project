    "In the beginning, I implemeted the simple LeNet network with only 5 layers that was explained in the lecture and no matter how I tried to process the image I was not able to achieve test accuracy above 0.9. Then I started to increased the layer a bit, because I think the deeper the network, the better the performance will be.  In order to prevent overfitting I also added a dropout process in between layer 4 and layer 5 because layer 4 has many nurons so it might cause overfitting.  Surprisingly, after I increased 2 more layers the accuracy increased immediately. However, it will not increase the performance even if I did a preprocess of training set. I will leave this as following research to see why the preprocess of the image did not help. \n",

    "* w.r.t the testing on online images:\n",
    "\n",
    "The only image that was not recongnized is due to the reason of resize, which makes the sign diffictult to recongnize either for out human eyes. You can that the input image of the unrecongnized one is very blur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* w.r.t the model constructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "I experimented that if I increased the NN layer from 5 to 7, the accuracy increased surprisely. However, there is no theory that can explain this. And also those parameters are tuned by trials and errors and I had no clue why should we decrease the learning rate or increase the EPOCH size or why should we do the image process. These will be left as future reseach."
